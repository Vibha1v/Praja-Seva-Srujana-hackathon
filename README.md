Project: Praja Seva
üí° The Problem
In remote and rural areas, access to modern healthcare facilities, trained medical professionals, and a steady supply of prescription medications can be a significant challenge. This often forces residents to rely on traditional knowledge, which may not always be sufficient or accurate, and can sometimes lead to serious health complications.

‚ú® Our Solution
Rural Health Remedies is a web-based portal designed to bridge the gap between traditional home remedies and accessible medical information. Our platform provides local pharmacists, community health workers, and even residents themselves with a simple, multilingual tool to find alternative medications and verified home remedies based on their symptoms or a doctor's prescription.

This project aims to:
Empower local healthcare providers with a quick reference tool.
Provide a safety net of medically-reviewed alternative options.
Reduce dependence on non-expert advice by centralizing information.
Improve health outcomes by offering safe, verified suggestions.

üöÄ Key Features
Multilingual Interface: The platform supports English, Hindi, and Kannada, making it accessible to a wider audience in rural India.
Dual Input Modes: Users can input either their specific symptoms or upload a doctor's prescription for analysis.
Categorized Suggestions: The system provides two distinct types of recommendations:
Home Available Remedies: Suggestions using common, locally available ingredients.
Alternative Medication: Information on alternative, non-prescription medications and wellness practices.
Modern, Responsive Design: The front-end is built to be clean, intuitive, and fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on low-end smartphones and tablets commonly used in remote areas.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Front End:
HTML5: For the core structure of the web pages.
Tailwind CSS: For rapid, utility-first styling and a professional design.
JavaScript: For all interactive elements, dynamic content loading, and multi-page navigation.
Back End (Future Implementation):

This version is a front-end prototype. For a full-scale deployment, a backend would be implemented using a technology like Node.js, Python/Flask, or Django. This would handle:
Symptom-to-Remedy matching logic.
Database management for storing medical data and remedies.
Image processing for analyzing uploaded prescriptions.
API endpoints for secure data exchange.
üíª How to Run Locally
This project is a single-page application and is ready to run.

Clone the Repository:
git clone [https://github.com/Vibha1v/Praja-Seva-Srujana-hackathon.git]
cd [praja seva]

Launch with Live Server:
The project is set up to be tested with the VS Code "Live Server" extension. Simply right-click the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server".

üõ£Ô∏è Future Scope
Backend Integration: Connect the front end to a robust backend system to provide intelligent, data-driven suggestions.
Prescription Analysis: Implement a machine learning model to read and interpret prescriptions from images, a key feature for rural areas where digital prescriptions are rare.
Community Contributions: Add a feature for authenticated pharmacists and health workers to submit and verify new remedies.
Voice Search: Integrate voice-based input to help users with low literacy.
Offline Functionality: Enable a Progressive Web App (PWA) to allow basic functionality without an internet connection.
